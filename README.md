## sorting-algorithms

Fantastic sorting algorithms and how to write them (in JS)!

Working on adding more tests and stats tracking.

Mostly written in ES6. Using promises to sort and test results.

Currently implements:
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Counting sort
- Merge sort
- Bucket sort

Instructions:
```
npm i
npm start
```

Work in progress...
